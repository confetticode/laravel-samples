# Laravel Samples

Laravel is a great framework to build web applications. It's designed for developers to start coding with zero configuration. It's so convenient, right? Behind the sense, it has a lot of components under `Illuminate` namespace and these components are defined, configured and automatically loaded. You seldom care about them, so do I.

The trust is we can use `Illuminate` components as stand-alone libraries like many other Composer packages. So I create this repository to write about how to use each component outside the framework itself. I do this like a hobby while reading Laravel framework code.
